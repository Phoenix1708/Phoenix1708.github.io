      <p>Nobody forces you to read on but obviously you are interested. Thanks. &#128275;</p>

      <p>Among many other things, I always wanted to learn about web development after graduating with computer science degrees.</p>
      <p>Yeah "how" indeed ... think about it. What you ended up doing everyday.</p>
      <br />
      <p>Also after graduation, I realised how important it is to document all the problems you've solved.</p>
      <p>Yes what a surprise ... I wish life happened to me differently, or don't happen to me at all ...</p>
      <br />
      <p>Nevertheless, however slow the idea finally came: Why not "one stone" them by building a web site of your own.</p>
      <br />
      <p>Not a bad idea but it drowned in the <u>ignorance of "how to grow as an intelligent being"</u> - which is just a fancy way of saying:</p>
      <p>Procrastination</p>
      <p>Emotionally unstable</p>
      <p>Magnet of distractions</p>
      <p>Lack of the ability to control myself</p>
      <p>being a thermometer not thermostat</p>
      <br />
      <p>Social dilemma ? Perhaps. The root cause is not that at all.</p>
      <p>I have smart phone, laptop, desktop, office chair, standing desk, dual monitors, clarinet, electronic keyboard, yoga mat, Echo Plus, Echo dot, air purifier, humidifier ... a balcony with nice view ... but I don't have "Me"</p>
      <p>My life has been burning for other people's agenda. Well, that's mostly because I don't have one for myself.</p>
      <br />
      <p>Time to stop this nonsense. This is my objectives, my design, my plan, my steps, my routine, my ritual. This is Me and only Me.</p>
      <br />
      <p>All these is actually for helping with the website design/content creation ... don't get too emotional &#128515;</p>
